    # Introduction
    Operation Code Resources API is a collection of programming and cyber security learning resources curated by and for the Operation Code community.

    # Authentication
    Create (POST) and update (PUT) routes are protected and require an API key. API key requests to the `/apikey` endpoint require valid Operation Code credentials in the request body.

    If you are not already a member of our community, join Operation Code [HERE](https://operationcode.org/join).

    When you create a request to an authenticated route, you *MUST* include the header `x-apikey` along with your API key.

    # Versioning
    To ensure contracts with the api are not broken with future updates, you may supply a version number in your request header.
    Include an `X-Api-Version` header with a valid version in your request:
      ```
      X-Api-Version: 1.0
      ```
    ### Default Versions
    By default, any non-versioned request will default to the newest version of the API. Users of the API are strongly encouraged to specify the requested version to avoid unexpected changes when new versions are added.
